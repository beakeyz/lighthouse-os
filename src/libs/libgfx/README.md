# libgfx (dl_gfx.sys)

The gfx system library
This library focusses on the graphics interface. This library works with either a graphics card driver, or a flat framebuffer

This library is split in a few parst:
 - interfacing with lwnd.drv (our driver for window management =) )
 - software rendering algorithms
 - (Hopefuly sometime) GPU rendering routines (Like Vulcan or OpenGL)
