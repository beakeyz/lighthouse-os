 * most USB devices will be connected through PCI so the different types of hosts
 * will get initialized through PCI drivers. The hosts will in turn initialize their own 
 * USB device specific drivers, based on the attached devices. For example, a USB mass 
 * storage device will probably just register another generic disk device object, register it and
 * then implement the generic high-level mass storage functions. Same goes for HID devices, like keyboards
 * and mice. These devices get a backend loaded on the PCI USB, but their frontends will simply consist of the hid_device 
 * that gets created and registered
