# The ACPI subsystem of the aniva kernel

Oh, how I love ACPI. At the time of trying to get this done I realized that 
I didn't know quite as much as I had hoped about ACPI and AML. The task I wanted 
to accomplish seemed impossible, but luckily there are a lot of opensource 
projects that have done the same thing I am trying to do. The AML part of the 
subsystem is VERY heavily inspired by the LAI AML interpreter and I have been trying 
to learn as much as I can about ACPI and AML as I can.

I know myself, and once this works good enough for my liking, I will probably just forget
this part of my codebase exists and go on with my life, but it seems that, since I 
find AML and ACPI very confusing, I need to study this part of systems design a little bit more
than I anticipated. 

Hence I want to make sure that the code I write here get looked over in the future and 
that everything I stole from the LAI interpreter gets replaced and recoded. I have found that
just diving into a subject head-first seems to work really well for me, but I just need 
to remember to refresh the old, stinky code that I wrote when trying to conceptualize the 
thing I was trying to do...
