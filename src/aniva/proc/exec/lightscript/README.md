# Support for lightscript

This is a concept, so please keep that in mind

lightscript is supposed to be a light-weight, highly functional, direct-kernel-access scripting language
that is directly embedded into the kernel. I still need to find a good use for this, but it's really just
an excuse for me to learn to program (semi high level) programming languages
