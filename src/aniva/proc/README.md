# The Aniva proc structure

This readme is a brief overview of the way processes work in Aniva
and a small roadmap / TODOs / writeouts of things we need to add in the
future.

## The mechanism

## (TODO) Process bootstrap resources

When a process is created we can give it a bunch of resources that it needs
for setting up its runtime. This includes files, kobjects, the filetype of 
the binary that we are trying to execute or simply a kernel function that acts
as a flat runtime.
