# Version 0.0.2: Reimagine the disk interface

<Introduction>
I hate the way the current disk subsystem is built in aniva. I would like to move to volume storage in the form of kernel object inside oss.
This way we can also provide userspace with the needed view into the disk layout it might need to do certain things (i.e. disk formatting
utilities).
We will simply put volumes in the %/Volumes node where they will be given an ID and where we can put their partitions as separate 'volumes'.

## Motivation
I hate the current system and it's code is ancient
## Outline
???
## Goals
- Give disk drivers a nicer interface to implement
- Give userspace access to a structured disk layout (kinda like /dev/sd(x) in linux (ew))
## Steps
