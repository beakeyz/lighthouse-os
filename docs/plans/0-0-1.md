# Version 0.0.1: Make proc profiles proc profiles again
Right now there are two 'proc' profiles present on a single system. Processes that 
are created simply get registered to these. We don't really like this system, which
is why we're going to redesign the system.
## Motivation
The initial system was put in place as a foundation for a user-profile-like system
inside the OS. This never really came to fruition sadly, so the consideration is to 
create a one-profile-like system. This means we support the idea that one machine is
operated by one individual.
Arguments for a multi-user approach:
1) More flexibility
2) Better isolation of resources
Arguments for a single-user approach:
1) Simplicity
2) Less work for me
3) More efficient
## Outline
We're going to remove the 'proc_profile' structure and replace it with pgroups 
("process groups") to manage multiple processes. To manage 'users' we're going 
to bring in just user profiles. There will be a static amount of those on the
system (probably only 'User' and 'Admin', which replace 'Global' and 'BASE').
These user profiles represent levels of execution privilege and since we only
need two levels of execution (privileged and unprivileged) there will probably
only be two user profiles. This, combined with the new pgroups, will change up
the structure for process execution and privilege a bit.

The structure will look a little something like this:

- User profile
    - pgroups
        - grouped processes

This comes with simple privilege inheritance. Processes that
are executing in a particular pgroup, will be 'limited' to their group.
It is important to note that groups can have both more and less privileges than the
user profile they run under and in order for a group to have more privileges than the
profile, the system needs the administrator key to elevate the group. This also goes
for any process that wants to be elevated to a group of higher execution privilege.

Furthermore there are a couple more notes:
1) There cannot exist a 'groupless' process, which means that the pgroup struct needs
to be lightweight
2) Control variables (formerly profile_vars) can be put into two categories: 'global'
(If the variable is attached to the user profile) and 'grouped' (If the variable is
attached to a pgroup).
3) When querying for control variables in a pgroup, the variables inside the userprofile
also need to be taken into account

## Goals
- Simplify process environment management
- ...
## Steps
1) [X] Create pgroups
2) [X] Ensure newly started processes get the correct pgroups
3) [X] Move profile_variables to ctlvars in order to make them a more system-wide struct
4) [X] Replace proc_profiles with user_profiles
5) [X] Standardise the initial profile layout of the system (Make sure the 'User' and 'Admin' profiles
are created correctly at boot)
6) [X] Move profile and variable serialization to their new structs
7) [ ] Make pgroups serializable
