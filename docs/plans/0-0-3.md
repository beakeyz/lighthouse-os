# Version 0.0.3: Big reimagine

In short: The current system is way to volatile in my opinion. I want to achieve a few things:

1) More (if not all things referable by a process) things to be aware of
the amount of references to their memory.

2) A bigger focus on processes to do stuff. The kernel really should (almost) never do things on its own, but rather
perform operations based on commands given by processes.

3) A system that revolves around the idea of handles. I really like the idea of bringing handles into kernel space and 
spreading that idea across the entire system, since we can check the validity of a handle at any time which gives way
more flexibility for object creation/deletion/mutation/ect.

4) A reimagined way to see vfs (or as we rebelliously call it: oss). I want to bring in 'registries' for every type of
kernel object that should be process accessible. This is not the type of registry there exists in windows, but rather an
object-specific implementation to organize the objects. Processes may be purely indexed by pid, whereas files still live
in a vfs-style registry. Registries can be accessed by name, or objects inside registries can be accessed vfs-style by
formatting the path like this: '<registry-name>:<path>'. This way <path> can be passed to the appropriate registry
in the correct format. One thing registry entries may always do is refer to other registries. This should be done
using point (3), where a registry entry holds a kernel handle to another registry, which ensures the registry is preserved
as long as that reference exists

## Steps

This is quite a big operation, so we'll have to split it into quite a lot of intricate steps.

1) Cripple user-space by bringing back the program count to one; we'll keep the 'init' program alive, since it should
   serve as the actual user-space initialization point in the future.

2) Cripple user-space even more by removing all libraries, except lightos. This library serves as the core for any lightos
   application, so we'll need to keep it alive, but strip it of all currently built utilities. The libc submodule already
   depends on a couple of lightos routines, so we'll keep those, but fill them with exit_noimpl calls, so we can re-implement them
   iteratively

3) Verify we can still launch the init binary from the kernel

4) Fully implement the kernel handle system. This means that objects that are subjected to the handle system, can only be referenced
   with a handle to them, and object owners should provide functions that can mutate the objects, purely through the object handle, so
   no direct pointer is ever required.

4) Assess which objects are user-accessible and which aren't. Start with creating registry drivers for those objects

5) Per object type, migrate them over to kernel handles and their registries. The order might be as follows, but is subject to change:
    a. Processes
    b. Threads
    c. Sysvars
    d. Files
    e. Devices
    f. Drivers
    g. Links (TODO: implement)
    h. Events and Eventhooks

6) Re-implement the lightos core library to account for this crap and implement handle operations to be the core of the lightos application interface.
   Handle operations will be pretty much the only way processes can interact with the kernel. It means that any syscall a process makes should have
   a handle it operates on. The only exceptions is the OpenRegistry() call, which is used to give processes access to the handles they operate on.
   The execution model should be as followed:
    1) Process opens a handle to the desired registry (most often done during library initialization)
    2) Process calls Open() to get access to the objects inside the specified registry
    3) Process calls functions that let the kernel perform operations on the specified handles on the processes behalf
    4) Process calls Close() to signal it's done with the handle (and thus the reference can be dropped).
