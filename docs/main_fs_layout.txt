When booting from a USB, we always get passed a ramdisk by the bootloader. When this happens, it gets interpreted by the kernel as its
root filesystem. When we are installed on a disk partition though, we want that to contain our main filesystem. Both should follow roughly the same 
layout, with the obvious difference that the filesystem on disk is mutable and can therefore differ in small things.

The main outline will be given here, per directory or vfs entry:

 - /Root: this is where the main filesystem gets mounted on the VFS. this should always be the same so the kernel knows where to find its shit
 - /Root/System: contains drivers and system-essensial stuff for the kernel (Like the kernel itself)
 - /Root/Apps: contains the installed applications that are global to the system (i.e. user independant)
 - /Root/Assets: A place where different assets can be dumped. Apps can request a directory here that they own where they can store their resources
 - /Root/User: contains the different user-owned directories and different user-related stuff
    - /Root/Global: contains the global user info
